# Airbnb-recommender-system-project
The goal of the Airbnb Recommender System project is to create a customised recommendation system for the widely used Airbnb holiday rental marketplace. The system makes property recommendations to users based on their interests and past actions using machine learning algorithms.
Data on users' tastes, prior reservations, property features, and guest opinions must be gathered and cleaned as the project's initial phase. To better forecast the accommodations a user will book, we will utilise this information to build machine learning models.
In last, the system will be fine-tuned for speed and scalability to accommodate the massive amounts of data produced by the infrastructure. In order to better serve its customers, Airbnb is working on a recommendation system that will adjust its suggestions to each user's specific tastes and habits.
